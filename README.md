## Overview

The challenge is to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

The process was quite difficult for me mostly in the media query for mobile and tablet views but I came up with something close to the final results.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used this section to learn about the media query in css and it was realy challenging but did my best to be close to the expected out come.

Also the form validation in js, I also learned a few stuffs

### Continued development

In further projects i would love more media quries to help me make more research to improve my skills and also want to build more advanced js projects
